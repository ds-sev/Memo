# Task
The page consists of a board of tiles (default 4x4). 
- every 2 tiles have the same color (it could be an image, it doesn't matter); 
- each tile is closed, so the user can not see a color (image). 
The gameplay is the sequence of rounds. In each round the user should select 2 tiles with the same color to make them disappear. If he selects 2 tiles with different colors then they are flipped to "closed" state, and the user proceeds with the next round. The game is considered to be over when all of the tiles are opened.

## About this project
This web-application is built with Vite + React. Redux was chosen for state management. Pure CSS is used for styling. The final build includes style-prefixes and polyfills, enabling it to run on outdated browsers. The project is deployed on GitHub Pages. The project features a calm design and a minimal set of animations. The responsive approach allows the application to be displayed on various screen sizes and devices without broken layouts.
